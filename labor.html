    <h2> What Kinds of Businesses Tend to Have Unfair Labor Practices?</h2>
      <p>
        There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as labor violations can occur in any industry or sector. However, some types of businesses may be more likely to have labor violations than others. Here are a few examples:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Low-wage industries: Industries that rely on low-wage workers, such as the fast food, retail, and hospitality industries, are often associated with labor violations. These industries may be more likely to engage in practices such as wage theft, unpaid overtime, and violations of health and safety regulations.

          </li>
          <li>
            Agricultural and farm labor: Workers in agricultural and farm labor may face numerous labor violations, including low wages, long hours, exposure to dangerous pesticides and chemicals, and inadequate access to healthcare.

          </li>
          <li>
            Manufacturing: Manufacturing jobs, particularly those in industries with global supply chains, may be associated with labor violations such as child labor, forced labor, and poor working conditions.

          </li>
          <li>
            Contract and temporary work: Contract and temporary workers are often more vulnerable to labor violations due to their precarious employment status. These workers may be subjected to low wages, lack of benefits, and unsafe working conditions.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
